object TestingActor {

  //Introduction
    // As with any piece of software, automated tests are a very important part of the development cycle.
    // The actor model presents a different view on how units of code are delimited and how they interact,
    // which has an influence on how to perform tests.
    // Akka comes with a dedicated module akka-testkit for supporting tests.

  // Asynchronous Testing: TestKit

     // Testkit allows you to test your actors in a controlled but realistic environment.
     // The definition of the environment depends very much on the problem at hand and the level at which you intend to test,
     // ranging from simple checks to full system tests.
